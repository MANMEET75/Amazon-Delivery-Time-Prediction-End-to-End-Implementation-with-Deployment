# Amazon Business Research Analyst Problem Statment
I solved a use case for Amazon Business Research Analyst by predicting the delivery time for an order. I created three environments: research, development, and production. In the research environment, I collected and cleaned data from Kaggle, performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, and model building. In the development environment, I converted the code into modular code and created a web application using Flask. In the production environment, I deployed the model using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and created a code pipeline for continuous delivery.
