# Amazon Business Research Analyst Problem Statment
I solved a use case for Amazon Business Research Analyst by predicting the delivery time for an order. I created three environments: research, development, and production. In the research environment, I collected and cleaned data from Kaggle, performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, and model building. In the development environment, I converted the code into modular code and created a web application using Flask. In the production environment, I deployed the model using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and created a code pipeline for continuous delivery.


## Research Environment
In the research environment, I collected and cleaned data from Kaggle, performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, and model building using regression algorithms with hyperparameter optimization for maximum accuracy. Open source libraries like category encoder and feature engine were used for reproducibility and robustness.

## Development Environment
In the development environment, we convert our code into modular code and create a web application using Flask. We create a repository on GitHub, create a virtual environment using anaconda, and create multiple files for components like data ingestion, data transformation, model building, and prediction pipeline. We also build an interactive UI for the ML application using full stack web development skills.


## Production Environment
Deployed model using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk with .ebextension configuration file. Deployment process includes creating new applications on AWS and integrating GitHub repository with AWS instance through CodePipeline. Continous delivery feature allows for easy updates to the codebase on GitHub.

## Here are some ways you can use this model to improve the business and increase profit:

1) Optimize delivery time: With the help of My model, Amazon can optimize delivery time by analyzing the factors that influence delivery time and taking corrective measures. This will result in a better customer experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, which in turn can result in increased sales and revenue.

2) Reduce costs: By optimizing delivery time and reducing delays, Amazon can save costs associated with late deliveries, rerouting orders, and customer complaints. Additionally, the model can be used to optimize the supply chain, reduce the number of returns, and improve inventory management, resulting in further cost savings.

3) Increase operational efficiency: The machine learning model can be used to improve the efficiency of the delivery process by optimizing routes, predicting demand, and reducing idle time. This will result in faster delivery times, better asset utilization, and increased throughput.

4) Create new revenue streams: Amazon can leverage the insights gained from the model to create new revenue streams, such as offering premium delivery services or providing real-time tracking and notification services to customers.

5) Enhance customer experience: By providing accurate delivery time estimates, Amazon can improve customer experience and increase loyalty. Additionally, the model can be used to personalize recommendations, offers, and promotions based on customer behavior and preferences.




Overall, this machine learning model has the potential to bring significant business value to Amazon by improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing the customer experience.
